<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

React Minesweeper is a small hobby project that I've created to put in practice a new way to create interfaces for WEB applications.

The game component was entirely created with a declarative UI.
That means, we have not a single CSS file in use.

Also, no image file was used to create the UI.
What you might think is an image, is basically an emoticon.

I made use of **Chakra UI** to create the interface.
And the rest of the code is simply **Typescript**.

Feel free to fork the project and use it as you will.
Just mention me somewhere :D



<!-- BUILT WITH -->
### Built With

The only dependency in this project is the **Chakra UI**, that is used to create the UI.

* [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com)

<!-- USING THE COMPONENT -->
## Using the Component

The "React Minesweeper" project provides one component called "Minesweeper" that you can add anywhere and have the game up and running! Check the code below. It adds the game to a ReactJS page.

```react.js
  import { Minesweeper } from './components/Minesweeper';

  export function SamplePage ()
  {
    return (
      <div>

        <Minesweeper size={{rows: 9, columns: 9}} bombs={10}/>

      </div>
    );
  }
```
